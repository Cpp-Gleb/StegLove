# <p><strong> &#128205; Hello ITMO STARS!</strong> 

<strong>Project Description </strong>

An application was developed based on the Qt framework for easy use of basic utilities with a clear interface. Custom widgets are written for uniqueness and beauty. Based on the flask framework, a web application with a built-in api was developed that allows you to analyze the file using various utilities such as exiftool, zsteg and so on. The web application can be accessed by specifying the name of the utility for analyzing the file in the route https://www.rjomba.com/<utility name>; in the future, it is planned to expand the utility base and improve the api. The web application was packaged in a Docker container for easy scaling and moving between servers. To fend off bot attacks, the cloudflare service was connected, which allows you to scale the infrastructure without fear of external interference. The application contains reference books that teachers can customize for a visual explanation of various utilities.
