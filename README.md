# <p><strong> &#128205; Hello ITMO STARS!</strong> 

<strong>Project Description </strong>

An application was developed based on the Qt framework for easy use of basic utilities with a clear interface. Custom widgets are written for uniqueness and beauty. Based on the flask framework, a web application with a built-in api was developed that allows you to analyze the file using various utilities such as exiftool, zsteg and so on. The web application can be accessed by specifying the name of the utility for analyzing the file in the route https://www.rjomba.com/api/exiftool 

In the future it is planned to add a database to save the query session, this will allow to return to analyses of files if the task could not be solved from the first time. Adding basic utilities to extend the capabilities. Adding a message broker to prevent analyses from being lost. Changing the language for writing the API and scaling the project.

The web application was packaged in a Docker container for easy scaling and moving between servers. A cloudflare service was connected to protect against bot attacks, allowing the infrastructure to scale without fear of external interference. The app contains guides that teachers can customise to explain different utilities clearly.
